# Morris Programming Language

Morris is a programming language to do the kind of programming I want to do faster, safer and more easily.

## Design Goals

### Parallel First
 - Everything is a Thread (Actor/Agent/Entity)
 - All complex systems (especially modern video games) are made up of multiple entities operating in parallel. Games especially.

### Easy To Learn
 - Familiar Syntax C like block structured syntax
 - No semicolons. This is especially useful for learners.
 - Explicit, No Hidden Computation.

### Safe
 - Stack Based Locals within a Actors
 - Heap Based Globals
 - No pointers because no dynamic heap allocation
 - No shared memory between Actors
 - Broadcast and Narrow cast Message Passing between Actors
 - When a Thread exits all the memory associated is released.

### With Bells On
 - Integrated Graphics and Multimedia Library
