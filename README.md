# Morris Language

Morris is a programming language to do the kind of programming I want to do faster more easily.
That is 'gameplay' programming.

## Design Goals

### Parallel First
- All complex systems (especially modern video games) are made up of multiple entities operating in parallel.
- A significant amount of programming effort is spent taking naturally parallel systems and organising them into pipelines.
- Anticipate games becomming fully distributed systems with geographics subdivisions.

### Familiar Syntax
 - C like block structured syntax

### Easy To Learn
 - C like block structured syntax
 - No semicolons (yay)

### Safe
 - No pointers 
 - No memory allocations etc.
 - Should a process crash then it is restarted by its supervisor (ERLANG)
 - Broadcast and Narrow cast Message Passing
