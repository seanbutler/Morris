# Morris Language

Morris is a programming language to do the kind of programming I want to do faster more easily.
That is 'gameplay' programming.

## Design Goals

### Parallel First
- A significant amount of programming effort is spent taking naturally parallel systems and organising them into pipelines.
- All complex systems (games) are made up of multiple entities operating in parallel.
  
### Familiar Syntax
 - C like block structured
 - Many of the risky things removed
 - No semicolons (yay)
